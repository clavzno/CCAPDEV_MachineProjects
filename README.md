# CCAPDEV MCO

## How to use?
- Same procedures as before, MCO3's phase will now be moved in a folder called `CCAPDEV-Phase3-Group12`. Please access that folder instead.
- Once inside, clone the said folder as all the packages/dependencies used in the project are in it.
- Further instructions in the `CCAPDEV-Phase3-Group12`'s README.md
